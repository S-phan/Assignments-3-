this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.Harriet Klausner
Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. 
My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.
If you enjoy a well told yarn of intrigue told so skillfully you are not able to predict the ending, a really good who-done-it, this is for you.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading Faith is a verb by Chris Goodrich. The book covers facts regarding the history of the organization Habitat for Humanity and the author's experiences volunteering. Goodrich writes about the places, the people, and the volunteers he has encountered during his five-year experience with Habitat for Humanity. The author speaks straight from the heart, some of which brought tears to my eyes, some of sadness, some of laughter. Even through all the heart-wrenching sights, Goodrich and his crew persevere, regardless of the obstacles they face. Goodrich's experiences include traveling around the world, from America to London from London to Paraguay even getting lost in the Sierra, Faith is a Verb, is a fantastic read. In addition, the book opens a person's eyes and heart to the devastation and suffering that many see everyday of their lives. The book puts into perspective just how lucky we are even though we may not think so; it made me not only look at my ethics and values but also encouraged me to pick up that hammer.
If you are stumped for the perfect gift to bring to your dinner host, to give to your dinner guests, or for any other small gift occasion, Furry Logic is the answer.  Everyone loves this book.
Whether intentional or not, this book's audience is the former or current military member.  But if you have read and enjoyed works such as the first two volumes of \\"Roots of Strategy\\", you should have no trouble following this book.    The author successfully shows that military personnel have mixed feelings about war.  Although he addresses behavior in the midst of battle, the author seems more interested in the views about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienced it and those who were looking backward in retrospect.  How those people felt in the midst of the madness is almost certainly different from how they anticipated or how they adjusted their feelings afterwards.  I think this \\"flavor\\" derives from his personal-interview-and-historical-research approach.  I do not see this as a negative but rather staying within his scope of knowledge and expertise.    The review titled \\"Flawed work of a historian with no sociological credibility\\" seems too harshly critical.  Perhaps this reviewer expected a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach.  As a note: page 58 cites S.L.A. Marshall as stating that only \\"some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\"  True, the subject of women in the military is barely broached.  However, in all fairness, the author never pretends to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there.  Perhaps that is a deficiency of character, but not of the book.  I get the feeling that this review didn't find what he wanted and then \\"skimmed\\" the book without thinking into what was being presented.      Although now much more interested in peace studies, I enjoyed reading this book.  I found a number of passages that shed light on where I have been and where I seek to go.  I don't see this as a pro-military book although at times it may seem so.  I characterize it as an honest endeavor to address and understand some of the difficult questions that most of us have concerning death and killing in war-time.
Temple to the wind is a riveting account of the Reliance story. I would also put it right up there with Seabiscuit and In the Heart of the Sea. The book is expertly written and extremely well researched. I found the biographical material about Herreshoff, Barr and Lipton very interesting. I especially enjoyed the fast paced play by play action of the races between Reliance and Shamrock III. I highly recommend Temple to the Wind.
At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.
I find \\"Photoshop  for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" to be a great book to add to your PhotoShop library.  It adds some great insight by several of the world's best known nature photographers.  Any book that has instructional information from John Shaw, Arthur Morris, Charles Glatzer, and Joe McDonald is well worth the investment.  One of the most difficult aspects of PhotoShop for me has been the effective use of curves.  Tim and Ellen do a much better job at helping with this complex matter than any other book I have read.  The effective utilization of PhotoShop requires as much of an artistic approach as it does as workflow approach.  Tim and Ellen do a very good job of fully developing a great workflow while introducing their own artistic approach.  No one book can every include all the aspects of PhotoShop that you will every need.  However, \\"Photoshop for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" does a great job of specilizing for nature photographers.  As with any workshop, it does require the student to do some work to get the most out of the class.  I recommend this book to any nature photographer who would like to improve their utilization and knowledge of PhotoShop. 
I love Aristotle and this is a good collection, but my book fell apart!  I had a course that used just this book, and despite the fact that we all took good care of our copies, nearly all of our books tore in half or lost pages.  Some actually had to make a new book out of it!
To his discredit, Dr. Unwin virtually brags in the introductory chapter that nearly all of the questions and arguments that have mystified pterosaurs since their discovery have been answered in recent years,  but when it comes time to reveal those answers, Unwin typically sidesteps. Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favorite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writing style is refreshing and easy to read (every chapter opens with short fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line work is rarely original and never detailed. Almost nothing is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here.
Hands down, the funniest book I've ever read.  It's touching, frustrating, and poignant.  I even related to this character, and I'm a 35 year-old woman.     Read it, you won't regret it!

this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are f the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yu nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the wld and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most impntantly about yuself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
If you are looking f something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking f a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no me to say
Though she is honed to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victia Colby-Camp is me euphic over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha Nth fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victia f abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.Fmer military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victia, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want me Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victia who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root f Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine auth on her A-game.Harriet Klausner
Review based on a cursy examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  We have found the book to be well ganized, and detailed. The structure placed the infmation in an easy to read and presentable manner. The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples suppted the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. 
My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 wds: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humous and the actual sty was interesting.It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking f a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot me than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.The sty is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the sty from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the sty of those 3 days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent hum.  I was st of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised sty because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel cpate wld' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised sty\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that wld in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make f me entertaining and me thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) bing mid-level cpate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least f purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things wked out the way they did.  As f the reader who criticized her f not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
When looking f &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very infmative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out me knowledge.
Never been much f enjoying histy, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.
If you enjoy a well told yarn of intrigue told so skillfully you are not able to predict the ending, a really good who-done-it, this is f you.
I thoughly enjoyed reading Faith is a verb by Chris Goodrich. The book covers facts regarding the histy of the ganization Habitat f Humanity and the auth's experiences volunteering. Goodrich writes about the places, the people, and the volunteers he has encountered during his five-year experience with Habitat f Humanity. The auth speaks straight from the heart, some of which brought tears to my eyes, some of sadness, some of laughter. Even through all the heart-wrenching sights, Goodrich and his crew persevere, regardless of the obstacles they face. Goodrich's experiences include traveling around the wld, from America to London from London to Paraguay even getting lost in the Sierra, Faith is a Verb, is a fantastic read. In addition, the book opens a person's eyes and heart to the devastation and suffering that many see everyday of their lives. The book puts into perspective just how lucky we are even though we may not think so; it made me not only look at my ethics and values but also encouraged me to pick up that hammer.
If you are stumped f the perfect gift to bring to your dinner host, to give to your dinner guests,  f any other small gift occasion, Furry Logic is the answer.  Everyone loves this book.
Whether intentional  not, this book's audience is the fmer  current military member.  But if you have read and enjoyed wks such as the first two volumes of \\"Roots of Strategy\\", you should have no trouble following this book.    The auth successfully shows that military personnel have mixed feelings about war.  Although he addresses behavi in the midst of battle, the auth seems me interested in the views about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienced it and those who were looking backward in retrospect.  How those people felt in the midst of the madness is almost certainly different from how they anticipated  how they adjusted their feelings afterwards.  I think this \\"flav\\" derives from his personal-interview-and-histical-research approach.  I do not see this as a negative but rather staying within his scope of knowledge and expertise.    The review titled \\"Flawed wk of a histian with no sociological credibility\\" seems too harshly critical.  Perhaps this reviewer expected a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach.  As a note: page 58 cites S.L.A. Marshall as stating that only \\"some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\"  True, the subject of women in the military is barely broached.  However, in all fairness, the auth never pretends to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there.  Perhaps that is a deficiency of character, but not of the book.  I get the feeling that this review didn't find what he wanted and then \\"skimmed\\" the book without thinking into what was being presented.      Although now much me interested in peace studies, I enjoyed reading this book.  I found a number of passages that shed light on where I have been and where I seek to go.  I don't see this as a pro-military book although at times it may seem so.  I characterize it as an honest endeav to address and understand some of the difficult questions that most of us have concerning death and killing in war-time.
Temple to the wind is a riveting account of the Reliance sty. I would also put it right up there with Seabiscuit and In the Heart of the Sea. The book is expertly written and extremely well researched. I found the biographical material about Herreshoff, Barr and Lipton very interesting. I especially enjoyed the fast paced play by play action of the races between Reliance and Shamrock III. I highly recommend Temple to the Wind.
At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign wldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press f this unprecedented franchise but several of my favite feign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just pri to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a pletha of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much me visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collects like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy f years to come.
I find \\"Photoshop  f Nature Photographers : A Wkshop in a Book\\" to be a great book to add to your PhotoShop library.  It adds some great insight by several of the wld's best known nature photographers.  Any book that has instructional infmation from John Shaw, Arthur Mris, Charles Glatzer, and Joe McDonald is well wth the investment.  One of the most difficult aspects of PhotoShop f me has been the effective use of curves.  Tim and Ellen do a much better job at helping with this complex matter than any other book I have read.  The effective utilization of PhotoShop requires as much of an artistic approach as it does as wkflow approach.  Tim and Ellen do a very good job of fully developing a great wkflow while introducing their own artistic approach.  No one book can every include all the aspects of PhotoShop that you will every need.  However, \\"Photoshop f Nature Photographers : A Wkshop in a Book\\" does a great job of specilizing f nature photographers.  As with any wkshop, it does require the student to do some wk to get the most out of the class.  I recommend this book to any nature photographer who would like to improve their utilization and knowledge of PhotoShop. 
I love Aristotle and this is a good collection, but my book fell apart!  I had a course that used just this book, and despite the fact that we all took good care of our copies, nearly all of our books te in half  lost pages.  Some actually had to make a new book out of it!
To his discredit, Dr. Unwin virtually brags in the introducty chapter that nearly all of the questions and arguments that have mystified pterosaurs since their discovery have been answered in recent years,  but when it comes time to reveal those answers, Unwin typically sidesteps. Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writing style is refreshing and easy to read (every chapter opens with sht fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line wk is rarely iginal and never detailed. Almost nothing is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here.
Hands down, the funniest book I've ever read.  It's touching, frustrating, and poignant.  I even related to this character, and I'm a 35 year-old woman.     Read it, you won't regret it!
